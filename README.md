# Bash-Scripts
Quick scripts for common tasks in Linux. Made on Debian and some will not work on other distros. 

These are scripts that I use on new installs to set up tweaks, environment variables, directories, SSH settings etc. There are also some that make everyday Linux use easier such as quickly viewing which networks are set to autoconnect, continuous VPN/network status updates, or automating remote access/backups.
